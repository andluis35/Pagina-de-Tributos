                    Harry Potter was first introduced in the novel Harry Potter
                    and the Philosopher’s Stone (also published as Harry 
                    Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone), as an orphan who is mistreated 
                    by his guardian aunt and uncle and their son. On his 11th birthday 
                    Harry discovers that his parents were a witch and a wizard and 
                    that he, a wizard himself, has been invited to attend Hogwarts 
                    School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He also learns that his parents 
                    had not perished in a car accident, as his aunt and uncle had 
                    told him, but that they instead had been murdered by an evil wizard 
                    named Voldemort. Harry was the only person to have ever survived 
                    an attack by Voldemort—by somehow rebounding the latter’s 
                    “killing curse”—which left him with a lightning-bolt-shaped scar on 
                    his forehead. Indeed, Harry’s mysterious survival had all but killed 
                    Voldemort, who was left disembodied, and the young boy was thus 
                    already a celebrated figure in the “wizarding” community. At Hogwarts 
                    Harry becomes fast friends with classmates Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger 
                    and finds a rival in Draco Malfoy. He is taken under the wing of the 
                    school’s headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. These relationships persist 
                    throughout the series, especially as the young wizards and witches grow 
                    older and are called upon to take sides in a growing wizard war.

                <p class="text-paragraph">
                    Unbeknownst to Harry, and to much of the wizarding world in general, 
                    Voldemort is planning a return to power. Although at first feeble and 
                    living as a parasite in a follower’s body, Voldemort makes attempts 
                    on Harry’s life beginning in the first book and continuing throughout 
                    the series. In the fourth volume, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire 
                    (2000), Voldemort regains his body and former strength through a magic 
                    ritual, and thereafter his army greatly increases in number. Harry and 
                    those who side with him—including some of his teachers, several classmates, 
                    and other members of the wizarding community—are forced on multiple 
                    occasions to battle Voldemort and his disciples, including the Malfoy family. 
                    The epic saga culminates with Harry accepting his role as the iconic 
                    “boy who lived” and facing almost certain death in the struggle against the 
                    evil wizard. With help from those who love him and believe in him, he is able 
                    to emerge victorious. Harry’s story continued in the play Harry Potter and 
                    the Cursed Child. Harry is married to Ginny Weasley, and they are the parents 
                    of James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna. Although working for the 
                    Ministry of Magic, Harry continues to struggle with his past, while 
                    Albus must contend with his father’s legacy.
