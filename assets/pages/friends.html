                    <h4>The Chaotic Weasley Twins</h4>

                        Of all the characters in Harry Potter, the Weasley Twins, 
                        Fred, and George stand out as the most mischievous, going 
                        against the school hierarchy throughout their years at Hogwarts. 
                        Throughout Harry's school years, Fred and George act as older 
                        brother figures in Harry's life, with Harry often staying with the 
                        Weasleys. When Harry fails to receive consent to go to Hogsmeade, 
                        Fred & George hand Harry a map to help him escape Hogwarts in order 
                        to reach Ron and Hermione. Even after Fred & George leave Hogwarts, 
                        the brothers still provide joy for students, including Harry, as 
                        they launch their prank store in Diagon Alley.

                    <h3>Neville Longbottom</h3>
                    <h4>From Shy Student To Hero</h4>
                    <img src="../images/neville-two.gif" alt="">
                    <p class="text-paragraph">
                        Besides Harry, Neville is the character that has grown the most 
                        throughout the story of Harry Potter. Starting as a shy kid who 
                        lacked friends, Neville was often picked on by classmates. Despite 
                        this, Harry became one of Neville's friends as they grew closer 
                        throughout their school years. When the whole of Hogwarts turns 
                        against Harry when he gets selected by the Goblet of Fire, Neville 
                        is the only student willing to be friends with Harry. Neville soon 
                        becomes Harry's trusted friend, as the pair eventually become involved 
                        in many battles alongside each other. The decisive battle that led to 
                        Harry defeating Voldemort came down to Neville's bravery, as he killed
                        Nagini, Voldemort's last Horcrux, allowing Harry to conquer the dark lord.

                    <img src="../images/gin.gif" alt="">
                    <p class="text-paragraph">
                        Initially starting as a shy girl from the Weasley household, Ginny 
                        later becomes Harry's wife as the pair develop their romance during 
                        their school years at Hogwarts. From very early on, Ginny and Harry are 
                        linked due to Ginny being held hostage by Tom Riddle in the Chamber of Secrets, 
                        eventually leading to Harry saving Ginny's life. As the pair grow older, their 
                        relationship grows stronger as Ginny becomes Harry's trusted ally when they go 
                        to save Harry's godfather, Sirius Black. By the end of the story, Harry and Ginny 
                        are shown as being married with children, solidifying their relationship.

                    <h4>Harry's Quirky Friend</h4>
                    <img src="../images/luna.gif" alt="">
                    <p class="text-paragraph">
                        Among Harry's trusted friends is Luna Lovegood, introduced in Harry Potter and 
                        the Order of the Phoenix. Despite Luna's quirky personality turning other students 
                        off her, Harry gravitates towards Luna as the pair bond over their shared ability 
                        to see Thestrals. When Harry goes to rescue Sirius Black in the battle of the Department 
                        of Mysteries, Luna is one of the select few who accompanies Harry, showing his trust 
                        in Luna as a friend and a wizard. The pair's relationship is strong, considering when 
                        searching for Horcruxes, Harry, Ron, and Hermione go to Luna's house to ask her father,
                        Xenophilius Lovegood, about the Deathly Hallows.

                        Dobby originally comes to Harry against the wishes of the Malfoy family. However, early 
                        into their relationship, Dobby manages to get Harry in severe trouble with the Dursleys, 
                        Harry's foster family. As Harry's house-elf, Dobby serves his master by warning Harry 
                        about the Chamber of Secrets at Hogwarts and the dangers it may cause. Dobby's presence 
                        in the films is limited compared to the books, with Dobby only reappearing in Harry Potter 
                        and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 to save Harry and his friends. As Dobby, Harry, and their 
                        party attempt to flee the Malfoy Manor, Dobby is struck by a knife thrown by Bellatrix, 
                        leading to his death. Dobby's sacrifice for Harry and his friends is not forgotten by the 
                        wizard, as he buries his house-elf with honor and respect.

                        From the beginning of Harry's life, Dumbledore has played a vital role, from delivering 
                        Harry to the Dursleys to leading Harry on the path to defeating Voldemort. As Harry 
                        develops his knowledge of magic throughout his years at Hogwarts, Dumbledore offers 
                        guidance and a shoulder to lean on for the young wizard who has the fate of the wizarding 
                        world on his shoulders.

                        Hagrid is the very first character from the wizarding world to contact Harry, informing the 
                        young boy that he has an invitation to attend Hogwarts. From the start of Harry's journey, 
                        Hagrid has been a source of comfort and friendship as Harry deals with issues within Hogwarts. 
                        Often accompanied by Ron and Hermione, Harry visits Hagrid at his hut to seek information, as 
                        the trio heavily relies on Hagrid. Hagrid is always present in many of Harry's most integral 
                        moments, with Hagrid being the one to carry his presumably dead body back to Hogwarts after 
                        Voldemort kills Harry. Just as Hagrid is the one to bring Harry into the wizarding world, Hagrid 
                        must be the one to see him out.

                        has been incredibly strong, with the pair being extraordinarily talented and sharp in 
                        their academics and dueling abilities. Hermione has always leaned on Harry for advice or 
                        comfort over the years regarding Hogwarts issues or her love for Ron. Even in dark times, 
                        Hermione goes to extreme lengths alongside Ron to help Harry in his quest to defeat Voldemort,

                        at Hogwarts. Harry and Ron immediately hit it off on their travels to Hogwarts, as they continually 
                        stand alongside Ron's future partner, Hermione, in many mischievous adventures involving danger. 
                        From playing a chess match of death to going into the Ministry of Magic in disguises, Ron has helped 
                        Harry defeat Voldemort despite enduring tough times throughout their relationship. Despite their 
                        dispute over events such as the Goblet of Fire controversy or Ron leaving during their search for 
                        Horcruxes, the pair always reconcile as best friends do.
