                        Harry James Potter (b. 31 July 1980) was an English half-blood
                        wizard, and one of the most famous wizards of modern times. 
                        The only child and son of James and Lily Potter, Harry's birth 
                        was overshadowed by a prophecy, naming either himself or Neville 
                        Longbottom as the one with the power to vanquish his arch-enemy, 
                        Lord Voldemort, one of the most powerful and feared Dark wizards 
                        in the world. After half of the prophecy was reported to Voldemort, 
                        courtesy of Severus Snape, Harry was chosen as the target due to 
                        his many similarities with the Dark Lord. This in turn caused the 
                        Potter family to go into hiding.
                        
                        Voldemort made his first attempt to circumvent the prophecy when 
                        Harry was a year and three months old. During this attempt, he murdered 
                        Harry's parents as they tried to protect him, but this unsuccessful attempt 
                        to kill Harry led to Voldemort's first downfall. This downfall marked the 
                        end of the First Wizarding War, and to Harry henceforth being known as 
                        "The Boy Who Lived", as he was the only known survivor of the Killing Curse 
                        due to being magically protected by his mother's loving sacrifice. In 
                        accordance with the terms of the prophecy, this attempt on his life also 
                        established him, not Neville, as Voldemort's nemesis.

                        One consequence of Lily's sacrifice was that her orphaned son had to be 
                        raised by her only remaining blood relative, his Muggle aunt Petunia Dursley, 
                        and her husband, uncle Vernon Dursley. While in their care, he would be 
                        protected from Lord Voldemort due to the Bond of Blood charm that Albus 
                        Dumbledore placed upon him. This powerful charm would protect him until 
                        he either came of age, or no longer called his aunt's house home. Due to 
                        Petunia's resentment of her sister and her magical abilities, Harry grew up 
                        abused and neglected.

                        Dursley was the surname of a Muggle family, the only known living close 
                        relatives of Harry Potter. Petunia Dursley was the older sister 
                        of Harry's mother, Lily Potter, but took the surname Dursley 
                        when she married Vernon Dursley. They had a son named Dudley.

                    <p class="text-paragraph">
                        Shortly before Harry's eleventh birthday, there were several attempts 
                        from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to send him a letter inviting 
                        him to not only come to Hogwarts, but also to explain his magical heritage. 
                        Though Vernon Dursley ultimately made the decision to leave their residence 
                        at 4 Privet Drive temporarily to evade the letters, his attempts were ultimately 
                        for naught. On his eleventh birthday, Harry learned from Rubeus Hagrid that he 
                        was a wizard. Rubeus Hagrid took Harry from the Dursley family the next day 
                        to Diagon Alley. This is where Harry withdrew some of his money from Gringotts 
                        Wizarding Bank, where Hagrid bought Harry's snow-white owl, Hedwig. While he 
                        was in Diagon Alley, Harry also got his school supplies (i.e., books from 
                        Flourish and Blotts, his robes from Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions, 
                        and his potion equipment from Slug & Jiggers Apothecary).

                        Harry began attending Hogwarts in 1991. The Sorting Hat told Harry that he would 
                        do well in Slytherin House, but Harry pleaded "not Slytherin". The Hat heeded this 
                        plea and sorted the young wizard into Gryffindor House.[54] At school, Harry became 
                        best friends with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. He was also the youngest Seeker 
                        in a century, making the house team in his first year when Minerva McGonagall introduced 
                        him to Oliver Wood, Gryffindor's Quidditch captain at the time. He later became the 
                        captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch Team in his sixth year, winning two Quidditch Cups. 
                        While in school, Harry also demonstrated an extraordinary talent for Defence Against the 
                        Dark Arts.

                        Harry played a significant role in many other battles of the Second Wizarding War. 
                        During what would have been his seventh year, he, Ron, and Hermione hunted down 
                        and destroyed Voldemort's Horcruxes. During the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry personally 
                        saw the deaths of Severus Snape and Fred Weasley while learning that Remus Lupin, 
                        Nymphadora Tonks, Colin Creevey, and many others had fallen in the battle as well. 
                        He encountered Voldemort and nearly sacrificed himself, knowing that his doing so was 
                        the only way to destroy the fragment of Voldemort's soul inside of him. While in limbo, 
                        after Voldemort cursed him in the forest clearing, Dumbledore gave Harry advice and 
                        background information on the Dark Lord. When told that he could choose to live or to 
                        "move on", Harry ultimately chose to live. After he awoke, Harry confronted Voldemort 
                        and defeated him once and for all.

                        Harry was also noted for being the only known Master of Death, having united the three 
                        Deathly Hallows at the mere age of seventeen.

                        After the war, Harry became an Auror and helped reform and revolutionise the Ministry 
                        of Magic. At some point, he married Ginny, with whom he had three children: James Sirius, 
                        Albus Severus, and Lily Luna. He was also named the godfather of Edward "Teddy" Remus 
                        Lupin. In 2007, Harry was promoted to Head of the British Auror Office at the age of 26, 
                        and would occasionally deliver Defence Against the Dark Arts lectures at Hogwarts. He 
                        was later promoted to Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement by the summer of 2020.
